              </p>
              <p>
                These TCU apply only to the Services identified above. Other sites, apps, services or content may have their own terms and conditions of use and should be reviewed.

              <p>
                The material available on our Sites, Apps and through other Services consists of information intended for health care professionals, for educational purposes only. Our Services do not provide medical advice, nor are they designed to provide information for non-health care professionals upon which any decision of any kind, medical or otherwise, should be based. Consumers and other users who are not health care providers should refer to their own health care professionals or, if appropriate, seek emergency medical care, to address their own concerns, issues, symptoms, or questions. Health care professionals must rely upon their own clinical and professional judgment before taking any action or rendering any advice of any kind regarding information contained on or through our Services. To put it more succinctly, if you are a patient or prospective patient, our Services are not a substitute for professional medical care. If you are a health care professional, our Services do not substitute for your own professional judgment.

                The Site and certain other Services may utilize various methods for users to upload or post content on or through such Services and to communicate with other users, health care providers, vendors, and third parties, such as forums, chatrooms, messaging or electronic mail. The content created of such interactions is referred to collectively as "user generated content" ("UGC"). Any and all UGC on our Sites, Apps or other Services are subject to these TCU.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any UGC you upload/post to the Sites or Apps or through other USHC Services is done on a non-proprietary and non-confidential basis, and you agree that USHC has a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display any UGC for the purpose of operating and/or marketing the Sites, Apps or any related Services. This license includes any right of publicity rights that may be present in the UGC.
              </p>
              <p>
                USHC is not required to treat any UGC as confidential. UGC that you share or post on or through the Services may be seen by other users of the Services (including off of the Services if another user copies and reposts your UGC).

              <p>
                When you utilize our Services for communications you further expressly agree as follows:

Any advertisements or solicitations of business are likewise prohibited. You are permitted to post links to other sites, but you may not post any material which you either do not own or do not have the express consent of the owner to use. In the event of any legitimate legal dispute over your UGC, we will reveal your identity and the address from which your content was posted.</li>
                <li>If you violate any provision of these TCU, we reserve the right to immediately and permanently ban you from participating in our Services, as well as notifying your service provider and any other entities involved.</li>

                <li>No physician-patient relationship can be created via the use of the Services.

                You further represent and warrant that: (i) you own all right, title, and interest, including the intellectual property rights, to any UGC uploaded/posted by you to the Services or you have granted the right by the respective owner to upload/post the UGC; and (ii) your UGC does not violate the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity.

                USHC reserves the right to comply and cooperate with any and all legal requirements, legal authorities, and/or law enforcement agencies regarding the investigation of, or request to disclose, information related to your UGC.
